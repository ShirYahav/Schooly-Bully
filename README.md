# Schooly-Bully 
Is a full stack app. Using node.js and mongoDB (Mongoose) for the backend and react.js and redux for the frontend, written in typescript and designed mostly with MUI library. 
Its an app that allows you to ask questions from specific books (learning material of elementary schools and high school) and answer the questions of others. 
Admin - can add a new books and delete irrelevant answers.
For protection I used the following libreries: striptags, uuid, express rate limit. And used functions such as preventGarbage, verifyAdmin and verifyUser.
